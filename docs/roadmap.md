# Roadmap

> No detailed planning yet.

*The following Issues are still **not** registered in GitHub on purpose, since it requires some planning. They will be transformed into Issues on demand.*


## Security

### Generate test cases that explore SQL Injection

Use declared Databases and Queries to formulate Test Cases that generate strings with SQL Injection commands.

### Add a test case that uses naughty strings as test data

Use a [list of naughty strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings) as test data.

### Sanitize all input file names

Sanitize files such as:
- CLI input files
- Concordia Import files
- Concordia Database paths

Use [this sanitizer](https://github.com/parshap/node-sanitize-filename)


## Language

### Language auto-detection

Auto-detect the language of specification files.

Maybe using [Franc](https://github.com/wooorm/franc) (preferred) or [LanguageDetect](https://github.com/FGRibreau/node-language-detect).


### Use UI Element Properties on value entities

Example:
```concordia
UI Element: Name
- min length is 2
    Otherwise I must see "${name} must have at least ${minlength} characters."
```

The string `"${name} must have at least ${minlength} characters."` will have:
- `${name}` replaced with `Name`
- `${minlength}` replace with `2`

Properties that could be allowed, in the format `${something}`:
- `name`;
- `id`, which default to the lower-cased `name` if undefined;
- `type`, which defaults to `string` if undefined;
- `datatype`, which defaults to `textbox` if undefined;
- `minlength`, which defaults to `0` if undefined;
- `maxlength`, which defaults to max string supported if undefined;
- `minvalue`, which defaults to minimal value supported if undefined;
- `maxvalue`, which defaults to maximum value supported if undefined;
- `value`, which will receive the value generated by the test case;


### Consider global UI Elements

Make the tool processing UI Elements tagged with `@global`.


### Allow inheritance of UI Elements

Use `@extends( <name> )` to extend another UI Element.

Example:
```concordia
UI Element: Name
- min length is 2
- max length is 100

@extends( Name )
UI Element: Emergency Contact Name

# Emergency Contact Name inherits the properties from Name
```


### Allow table matching

Allow a given UI Element or UI Literal to match a certain Table.

Example 1:
```concordia
Then I see {MyTable} as [Some Table]
```
Example 2:
```concordia
Then I see <myTable> as [Some Table]
```

In which `Some Table` is declared like this:
```concordia
Table: Some Table
| Name  | Age |
| Bob   | 21  |
| Suzan | 25  |
```


## CLI

### Guided configuration

Adding a `init` parameter to the CLI (i.e., `concordia init`) as step-by-step guide to configure Concordia. The configuration must be stored in a file such as `.concordiarc`. If the file already exists, it must be overwritten.

Using [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) could help with the guide.


## Performance

### Do not regenerate tests when a feature file and its dependencies have not changed their hash

Maybe it could be used a config file with the hashes, similar (but simpler) to what `package-lock.json` does, to control features' hashes.

Example:
```json
{
  "hashes": {
    "feature1.feature": "ox10JBprHtu5c8822XooloNKUfk=",
    "subdir/feature2.feature": "DMcj5b67Albe4KhpzyvphC5nVDHn1oCO",
  }
}
```


## Tool integration

### Integration with text editors

Create new projects for auto-completion plug-ins for text editors such as VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.

*Add here some inspiring projects.*:
- VS Code: [gherkin-autocomplete](https://github.com/silverbulleters/gherkin-autocomplete)


### Integration with reporting tools

Create integration with reporting tools, such as:
- [Allure](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/)
- [Macaca Reporter](https://github.com/macacajs/macaca-reporter)
- (add others here)

### Integration with testing platforms

To integrate with platforms like [MacacaJS](https://macacajs.com/), in order to provide all the setup needed to run the tests, specially for Android/iOS.


## Internal

### Use a linter

Configure the project to use [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint).
